# WikiLinks-Search

This is part of our data structures final project. It is used to  find out how links you need to click to get from one page on Wikipedia to another.

Our full report can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwJo0xeqmvZmZUQ0YUhwbF9GN1U/view

The files in this repo contain the search part of the program which uses the database generated by WikiLinks parse to actually compute the distance.
